# Windows-Text-to-speech-with-python
This program speaks what is in arguments. Just run the program with some arguments.
Example - ArgumentSpeaker.py "Hello world" 0 0 100
Output - Speak "Hello world", default voice, voice rate 0, volume 100

The voice changing is not done...

You can do random speak.
In argument 1 - "Hello | Hi | Hey"
This will choose randomly one word and speak it.

When you use GoodMAE in argument 1, it will change to good morning, good afternoon or good evening.
